## FAQ

#### What tools did you use to build this?

I built this webpage using Vue, Vue Router, and TailwindCSS. I used Vite for tooling and project scaffolding, as well as their hot reloading.

#### Were you employed at this company?

No, I was not employed at this company. I was hired as a freelancer.

#### How quickly was this project built?

I built this in a week. 

#### How did you get the design?

I created the design myself. I took bits and pieces from 3-7 templates I found on sites such as 
[Behance](https://behance.net) and [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com), and integrated them into several designs.
Once the client approved a design, I went on to develop it.

#### What did you learn from this?

I learned how to use Vite for Vuejs and Vue Router. This webpage had two pages but I still
decided to go with Vue Router since I would be using it in future projects anyway; I got a 
grasp of it and am currently using it in future projects like 
[this one](https://github.com/danialhasan/unsplash_clone). Vite was a new technology at the time
that I adopted it into the project, but the docs were helpful in helping me set up. Vite allowed
me to work extremely quickly with its hot-reload speed and templating setup, which made me want 
to use it in the future.
